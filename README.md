# My portfolio

## About the project 🚀
This repository houses the source code and infrastructure configuration for my personal portfolio website. Below an overview of the key aspects:

- **Frontend:** Built using `Angular` and styled with `Tailwind CSS` for a responsive and customizable design;
- **Hosting:** The application leverages Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. The static website content is stored in an `S3 bucket`, providing a scalable and highly available hosting solution. `CloudFront` is utilized as a CDN to ensure low-latency access for users worldwide, while `Route 53` manages the domain routing;
- **IaC:** The infrastructure is managed entirely as code using `Pulumi` as IaC tool, ensuring consistent and version-controlled infrastructure. Pulumi allows for the definition of complex cloud architectures using familiar programming languages, facilitating easier maintenance and evolution of the infrastructure;
- **CI/CD:** Utilizes `GitHub Actions` to define a pipeline for deploying both the updated website content and any infrastructure changes to AWS. This ensures that the live website always reflects the latest changes in the repository.
